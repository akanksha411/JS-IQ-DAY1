    <h2>JS Interview Preparation-DAY1</h2>
    <h3>1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-> Both are comparison operator. They both return boolean value.
       "=="  just compare the value where as "===" compares values as well as datatype.
         Ex:  X=2                   X==Y :true
               Y="2"                X===Y: false
    </pre>
    <h3>2. What is the spread operator?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-> New addition to the ES6 JavaScript.Allows us to destructure the non-primitive datatypes(array,object)
        EX:    let arr=[1,2,3]
                 console.log(...arr)
    </pre>
    <h3>3. What are the differences between var, let and const?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-> var is introduced before ES6 Whereas let and const introduced on ES6 version of JavaScript.
      The scope of var is functional scope whereas the scope of let and const is block level
      var can be updated and redeclared in the scope. let can be uplated but not redeclarable. const can't be updated and redeclared.
      var and let can be declared without initialization but const can't         
    </pre>
    <h3>4. What is execution context?</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-> When browser encounters script tag, JS engine creates a new environment for execution. This environment is known as execution context.
           Two kinds of execution context
                i)GEC (Global Execution Context)
               ii)FEC  (Functional Execution Context)
            The creation of execuition context happens in two phase.
               i)Creation phase-->Memory allocation, variable etc happens here.
               ii)Execution Phase--> Code execution happens here.   
    </pre>
    <h3>5. What is meant by first class functions</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-> A programming language is said to have first class function when functions in that languages are treated like any other variable.
          JS has first class function,that can be
               i) Assigned to variables
                      const foo=()=>{
                        console.log('foobar')
                      }
                      foo();
               ii) Passes as argument to functions.
                        function printHi(){
                            console.log('Function passed as an argument')
                        }
                        function execute(functionAsArgument){
                            functionAsArgument();
                        }
                        execute(printHi)
               iii) Returned from functions.
                         function getF(){
                            return function(){
                                console.log('I am function returned from another function'); 
                            }
                         }
                         let fn=getF();
                         fn();
    </pre>
    <h3>6. What are closures? Give an example of closure</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-> Closure is a function that has acess to the variables in its lexical environment even when it is executed outside the environment.
            function makeCounter(){
                let count=0;
                return function(){
                    count +=1;
                    return count;
                }
            }
            const counter=makeCounter();
            console.log(counter());
            console.log(counter());
    </pre>
    <h3>Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()</h3>
    <pre>
Ans-->The call method is used to call a function with a specified this value and arguments passed as individual values. 
            Example:  
            function test(arg1,arg2){
                console.log(this.name,arg1,arg2);
            }
            const testName={
                name:'Prepbytes'
            }
            test.apply(testName,100,200)
      The apply method is similar to call() but arguments passed as array.  
            Example:
            function test(...arguments){
                console.log(this.name,arguments);
            }
            const testName={
                name:'Prepbytes'
            }
            test.call(testName,[100,200])
       The bind method is used to create a new function, that has the same body of the original function, but with a specified this value and arguments. 
            Example
            function test(arg){
                console.log(this.name,arg);
            }
            const testName=test.bind(name:'Prepbytes','EA17')
            testName()
